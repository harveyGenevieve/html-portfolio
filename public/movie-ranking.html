<h3>180 degrees longitude passes through us</h3>

<p>This series left a deep mark on me. I have such difficulty accepting the ending, it's so tragic. It's the total opposite of what I would have done in MC's situation and I feel that I have so much to learn from MC's emotional maturity. I am crazy enough to accept less than ideal conditions for the sake of love. I crave love to the point of not respecting myself. This series has such important life lessons for me to take away.</p>

<h3>Addicted</h3>

<p>This is the polar opposite of the first series; an example of how far people will go for love no matter how crazy and disadvantageous the circumstances are. An example not to follow for sure, but a story that holds much meaning and fascination to me.</p>

<h3>I told sunset about you</h3>

<p>Once again, heartwrenching story of impossible love. I cried so much watching this, it's great. An amazing emotional rollercoaster.</p>
